## Piloting the analysis of manual ratings with simulated data

- `simulate_data.R` is a script to simulate raters manually assigning quality grades to subjects in original and defaced conditions. The simulated data have a positive bias towards defaced ratings.

- In `vary_dataset_parameters_anova.ipynb` we perform a sensitivity analysis to verify how many ratings do we need for the model to detect a significant effect of defacing.

- `visualize_simulated_ratings.ipnyb` is a notebook to visualize the distributions of simulated ratings, including categorical ratings.
