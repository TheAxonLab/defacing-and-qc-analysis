## Statistical analysis associated to the defacing pre-registration.

Manual ratings

- `simulate_data.R` is a script to simulate raters manually assigning quality grades to subjects in original and defaced conditions. The simulated data have a positive bias towards defaced ratings.

- In `VaryDatasetParameters_ANOVA.ipynb` we perform a sensitivity analysis to verify how many ratings do we need for the model to detect a significant effect of defacing.

- `VisualizeSimulatedRatings.ipnyb` is a notebook to visualize the distributions of simulated ratings, including categorical ratings.
