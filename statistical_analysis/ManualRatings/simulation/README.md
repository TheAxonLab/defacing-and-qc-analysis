## Statistical analysis associated to the defacing pre-registration.

Manual ratings

- In `vary_dataset_parameters_anova.ipynb` we perform a sensitivity analysis to verify how many ratings do we need for the model to detect a significant effect of defacing.

- `visualize_simulated_ratings.ipnyb` is a notebook to visualize the distributions of simulated ratings, including categorical ratings.
