## Statistical analysis associated to the defacing pre-registration.

Manual ratings
- `simulate_data.R` is a script to simulate raters manually assigning quality grades to subjects in original and defaced conditions. The simulated data have a positive bias towards defaced ratings.

- `VisualizeRatings.ipnyb` is a notebook to visualize the distributions of ratings in the defaced vs original conditions. 

- `ANOVA.ipynb` is the notebook to run repeated measure ANOVA and check its assumptions.
- In `VaryDatasetParameters_ANOVA.ipynb` I performed a sensitivity analysis to verify how many ratings do we need for the model to detect a significant effect of defacing.
